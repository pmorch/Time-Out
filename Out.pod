=head1 NAME

Time::Out - Easily timeout long running operations


=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Time::Out ;

  timeout $nb_secs => affects {
    # your code goes were and will be interrupted if it runs
    # for more than $nb_secs seconds.
  } ;
  if ($@){
    # operation timed-out
  }


=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Time::Out> provides an easy interface to I<alarm(2)> based timeouts.

=head2 EXPORT

C<Time::Out> exports 2 symbols, 'timeout' and 'affects'. However, these 
should only be used according to the syntax shown above.

=head2 RETURN VALUE

'timeout' returns whatever the code placed inside the block returns:

  use Time::Out ;

  my $rc = timeout 5 => affects {
	return 7 ;
  } ;
  # $rc == 7


=head1 C<Time::HiRes>

If C<Time::Out> sees that C<Time::HiRes> has been loaded, it will use 
that 'alarm' function (if available) instead of the default one, allowing 
float timeout values to be usedi effectively:

  use Time::Out ;
  use Time::HiRes ;

  timeout 3.1416 => affects {
	# ...
  } ;


=head1 BUGS

One drawback to using 'timeout' is that it masks @_ in the affected code. 
This happens because the affected code is actually wrapped inside another 
subroutine that provides it's own @_. You can get around this by 
specifically passing your @_ (or whatever you want for that matter) to 
'timeout' as such:

  use Time::Out ;

  sub test {
    timeout 5, @_ => affects {
      print "$_[0]\n" ;
    } ;
  }

  test("hello") ; # will print "hello\n" ;
